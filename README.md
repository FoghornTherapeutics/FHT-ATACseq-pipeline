# Overview

Chromatin DNA replication and gene transcription occur when the higher-order structure of DNA becomes loose, which is what we call open chromatin. Identifying these open regions is crucial because they often hold the keys to how genes are controlled and understande the genome's regulatory landscape.

Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATACseq) is a powerful technique that has revolutionized our understanding of the genome's regulatory landscape. It uses sequencing adapters, like cutting enzyme, to fragment the open chromatin and, after purification, the library can be amplified by PCR. Then it can be analyzed by NGS to obtain fastqs.
